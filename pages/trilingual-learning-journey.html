                <p>Growing up liking games and stuff from Japan as an Indonesian, I learn to understand English and Japanese from very young age, though learning Japanese take a bit later in my life. As I said, I really like playing games, been playing them since I'm still in the kindegarden. And at that time (and even now) there's little support for Indonesian language for ingame text, so I had to guess the meaning of each words so I can finish games, sometimes I also ask my older brother to translate things for me though.</p>
                
                <p>Even though I say I learn English since young, that doesn't mean I'm capable at speaking English fluently, what I got from endlessly playing games after school is that I can read faster than everyone in my age at school. And I have no problem learning English vocabulary since I got exposed to it everytime I play games anyway. I actually almost never learn English seriously before entering high school, that's why my English communicating skill is not that good.</p>
                
                <p>In my 3th years on grade school, around 2008, I started to listen to Japanese songs because my brother really like them, at that time, most of the things I enjoy comes from my brother stuff, even the games, so we develop similar taste growing up. Songs I listen to is mostly anime songs from TV animes, but my favorite is YUI's songs, I even still listened to her songs to this day. From her songs, I learn some Japanese vocabulary, I learned how to pronounce them while singing to her songs.</p>
                
                <p>For Japanese, I started learning it 4 years later when I enter junior high school, at the school I got some friends or perhaps circle that were into Japan stuff, like Anime, mangas, and other pop stuffs. That time I was a hardcore weeb, and I got freedom to get stuff for myself with internet I bought with my school allowance, I got into online anime community, Japanese learning community, and then started learning the Japanese 'alphabets', the Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.</p>
                
                <p>At that time, bringing phone to school is prohibited, so I would bring my Japanese book (that I borrowed from my brother) to school and start learning the Japanese letters. It took me 1 week to memorize the hiragana and another 1 week for katakana. At that time it's still hard to read things with just those things though, my handwritings is also still terrible. So I started learning entry level kanji and improving my overall Japanese skill.</p>

                <p>Learning English and Japanese at that time is merely a hobby and I did so to be able to enjoy more stuff I watch, play, and read. The serious learning starts in 2015 when I enter high school. There's a Japanese club there, and then I would get into Japanese competitions until I graduate from there. I will tell the story of my high school later in another part since it is a big part of my life story.</p>
